# ZendIT
ZendIT is an Email and SMS scheduling Web App which lets users schedule and manage their tasks
effectively with ease. Once the user signs Up on our platform he/she can schedule the sending of Emails or SMS and can manage all the schedule tasks through the dashboard. The dashboard contains all the scheduled tasks of the current week and any event can also be cancelled anytime before the scheduled time.

### Technology Used :-

**Frontend**- HTML , CSS , Javascript , Bootstrap

**Backend** – NodeJS , ExpressJS , MongoDB

**API** – Twilio API




### Use Cases of ZendIT:-

1) Scheduling sending of  important emails early morning when you couldn’t get up early due to some reason(maybe ill or something)
2) Schedule Birthday and Anniversary wishes sharp at midnight when you’re not in a condition to stay up late night.
3) Self reminders of important tasks and deadlines via SMS and Email.
4)In an Organisation, to send reminders about meetings , daily tasks etc.

### Main motive behind building ZendIT:-

As an individual , I personally felt the need of the use cases mentioned above and that triggered me to build ZendIT. Although I understand that there is a schedule feature implemented in Gmail already, but as a Developer there is no greater Joy than building things on own and implementing them by understanding what exactly happens  behind the scenes. Who wouldn’t love to build something which could be used not only by him/her but also by many other individuals who feel there is a need for something and thus, ZendIT was build.
